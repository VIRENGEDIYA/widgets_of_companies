I am creating 2 pages as below.

1. Home : 
    => In home page there are 3 modules:
      1. Create New Company :
      2. Create New Person: (if at least company is available)
      3. List of Company

2. CompanyDetails :
    => In companyDetails page there are only showing selected company details.


There are some installed packages as below.

    "bootstrap": "^4.4.1",             => For UI
    "react": "^16.13.1",               => React Library

But Remaining functionalities and features are done. but I have make code more and more reusable. so please check it out. Thank you...
